Description: SSRF via DNS rebinding vulnerabilities occur when attackers use DNS manipulation to make the server access internal resources.
Mitigation: Implement input validation, restrict requests to trusted domains, and configure DNS properly.
Clickjacking Vulnerability:

Description: Clickjacking vulnerabilities occur when an attacker tricks users into interacting with hidden malicious elements, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
Mitigation: Implement X-Frame-Options or Content Security Policy headers to prevent clickjacking.
Security Misconfiguration:

Description: Security misconfiguration vulnerabilities result from improperly configured security settings, allowing unauthorized access to resources or sensitive information.
Mitigation: Regularly audit and review security configurations and ensure they are set up correctly.
